Issue description: Hey,

in my application I implemented a method to get the currently connected user count backed by the implementations of the SimpUserRegistry interface, which is used for monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, this involves creating a completely new HashSet every time.

What about an additional method to just get the user count in a more allocation-friendly manner? Much like Method.getParameterCount() in Java 8.

Attached you will find my proposal, but if I missed something feel free to adjust it accordingly.

Cheers,
Christoph
